There are no backend SQL files, when my prof closed the course he also closed the server hosting our database and we don't have access to them anymore.


Other than that everything is here for said project my group and I made. 
  - The code is not necessarily secure as it was made to show SQL skills
  - The php may be wonky, it was created by me where I learned and implemented the PHP within 2 weeks (no we did not learn PHP before this idk why)
  - There may be some unused files here that you can refer to for styling and implementing new functions and such.
  - "mysqli" file is where most of the functions I wrote are as well as some of the default template ones. 
  - Hope you enjoy!
