SimpleBanking WebApp.

This is a WebApp created as a final project in a databases course I took at Eastern Illinois University.

There are no backend SQL files, when my professor closed the course he also closed the server hosting our database and we don't have access to them anymore.
-It should be noted I made 8 SQL tables and populated with data and interacted with them through this webapp.

Other than that everything is here for said project my group and I made. 
  - The code is not necessarily secure as it was made to show SQL skills and basic understanding of PHP.
  - The php may be wonky, I wrote and learned/implemented the PHP within 2 weeks (learning php was not included in the course, I did so for purpose of the project)
  - There may be some unused files here that you can refer to for styling and implementing new functions and such.
  - "mysqli" file is where most of the functions I wrote are as well as some of the default template ones. 
  - Hope you enjoy!
